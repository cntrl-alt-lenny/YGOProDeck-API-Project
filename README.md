# YGOProDeck-API-Project
A Python tool to fetch YGOProDeck card data based on user parameters and export it to Excel, aiding deck building and data analysis.

# Yu-Gi-Oh! API by YGOPRODeck
You can support our free Yu-Gi-Oh! API by purchasing a subscription to YGOPRODeck Premium.

This is currently the latest API version (v7).

NOTE ON IMAGES: Do not continually hotlink images directly from this site. Please download and re-host the images yourself. Failure to do so will result in an IP blacklist. Please read this guide on where to download images.

Upgrade Note: Please read through the documentation before upgrading to v7. Your code will not work if you simply change th endpoint to v7, please read the documentation below.

Older Versions
- All older versions of the API are now deprecated.

API Changelog v7 (last update 7th December 2023):
- ygoprodeck_url is now returned for all cards.

Our Yu-Gi-Oh! API is now available for public consumption. Below are the details on how to use the API and what kind of response is to be expected from the API.

Please download and store all data pulled from this API locally to keep the amount of API calls used to a minimum. Failure to do so may result in either your IP address being blacklisted or the API being rolled back.

Rate Limiting on the API is enabled. The rate limit is 20 requests per 1 second. If you exceed this, you are blocked from accessing the API for 1 hour. We will monitor this rate limit for now and adjust accordingly.

Our API responses are cached on our side. The cache timings will be given below. These are subject to change.

# Get Card Information
The Card Information endpoint is available at `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php`

This is the only endpoint that is now needed. You can pass multiple parameters to this endpoint to filter the information retrieved.

The following endpoint parameters can be passed:
- name - The **exact** name of the card. You can pass multiple `|` separated names to this parameter (`Baby Dragon|Time Wizard`).
- fname - A fuzzy search using a string. For example `&fname=Magician` to search by all cards with "Magician" in the name.
- id - The 8-digit passcode of the card. You **cannot** pass this alongside name. You can pass multiple comma separated IDs to this parameter.
- konami_id - The Konami ID of the card. **This is not the passcode**.
- type - The type of card you want to filter by. See below "Card Types Returned" to see all available types. You can pass multiple comma separated Types to this parameter.
- atk - Filter by atk value.
- def - Filter by def value.
- level - Filter by card level/RANK.
- race - Filter by the card race which is officially called type (Spellcaster, Warrior, Insect, etc). This is also used for Spell/Trap cards (see below). You can pass multiple comma separated Races to this parameter.
- attribute - Filter by the card attribute. You can pass multiple comma separated Attributes to this parameter.
- link - Filter the cards by Link value.
- linkmarker - Filter the cards by Link Marker value (Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Left, Top-Right). You can pass multiple comma separated values to this parameter (see examples below).
- scale - Filter the cards by Pendulum Scale value.
- cardset - Filter the cards by card set (Metal Raiders, Soul Fusion, etc).
- archetype - Filter the cards by archetype (Dark Magician, Prank-Kids, Blue-Eyes, etc).
- banlist - Filter the cards by banlist (TCG, OCG, Goat).
- sort - Sort the order of the cards (atk, def, name, type, level, id, new).
- format - Sort the format of the cards (tcg, goat, ocg goat, speed duel, master duel, rush duel, duel links). Note: Duel Links is not 100% accurate but is close. Using tcg results in all cards with a set TCG Release Date and excludes Speed Duel/Rush Duel cards.
- misc - Pass `yes` to show additional response info ([details](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/#misc-info)).
- staple - Check if card is a [staple](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/search/?&type=Staple).
- has_effect - Check if a card actually has an effect or not by passing a boolean true/false. Examples of cards that do not have an actual effect: Black Skull Dragon, LANphorhynchus, etc etc.
- startdate, enddate and dateregion - Filter based on cards' release date. Format dates as `YYYY-mm-dd`. Pass `dateregion` as `tcg` (default) or `ocg`.

You can also use the following equation symbols for **atk**, **def** and **level**:
"lt" (less than), "lte" (less than equals to), "gt" (greater than), "gte" (greater than equals to).

Examples: atk=lt2500 (atk is less than 2500), def=gte2000 (def is greater than or equal to 2000) and level=lte8 (level is less than or equal to 8).

The specific results from this endpoint are cached for **2 days (172800 seconds)** but will be manually cleared upon new card entry.

Additional Response for Link Monsters
- linkval - The Link Value of the card if it's of type "Link Monster".
- linkmarkers - The Link Markers of the card if it's of type "Link Monster". This information is returned as an array.

Card Sets
- You can now optionally use `tcgplayer_data` parameter. Using this will replace our internal Card Set data with TCGplayer Card Set Data.
- **NOTE:** If using `tcgplayer_data`, we cannot guarantee that Set Names, Rairites and other info are correct. TCGplayer have occasionally made up Rarity names in the past and don't always conform to correct Card Set Names. A prime example of this is "Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon" which TCGplayer lists as "The Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon".
- A Card Sets array is now returned as of v5. card_sets
- The array holds each set the card is found in. Each set contains the following info: set_name, set_code, set_rarity, set_price.
- If using `tcgplayer_data`, the API will also return `set_edition` and `set_url`.
- set_price is the $ value.

Card Images
- A Card Images array is now returned as of v5. card_images
- The array holds each image/alt artwork image along with the Card ID. Each set contains the following info: id, image_url, image_url_small, image_url_cropped.
- Take this example: `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php?name=Decode%20Talker`
- It contains two sets of Card IDs/Images within the card_images array. This is for the default artwork and the additional alternative artwork.

Card Prices
- A Card Prices array is now returned as of v5. card_prices
- The array holds card prices from multiple vendors. **This is the lowest price found across multiple versions of that card**.
- cardmarket_price - The price of the card from Cardmarket (in â‚¬).

##  Endpoint Languages

We offer the API in the following langugaes: English, French, German, Portuguese and Italian.

Card images are **only stored in English**.

Newly revealed cards leaked from Japan are available only in **English** until the official translation is released.

There are a handful of cards which may not have a translation yet but each language contains over 9000 cards translated. You can reach out to us on [Github](https://github.com/AlanOC91/YGOPRODeck/issues) to report any translation misses/issues.

Languages can only be queried on `cardinfo.php` and must be passed with `&language=` along with the language code.

The language codes are: `fr` for French, `de` for German, `it` for Italian and `pt` for Portuguese.

Language Examples:

[Survival of the Fittest](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest) in French
- `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php?name=Survie%20du%20Plus%20Fort&language=fr`

Get the 5 latest cards in German
- `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php?language=de&num=5&offset=0&sort=new`

##  Card Images

**Images are pulled from our image server `images.ygoprodeck.com`. You must download and store these images yourself!**

Please only pull an image **once** and then store it locally. If we find you are pulling a very high volume of images per second then your IP will be blacklisted and blocked.

Our card images are in `.jpg` format and are web optimized.

All of our cloud URLs will either be `https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/` (full size images), `https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_small/` (small size images) or `https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/` (cropped image art). You pass the ID of the card to retrieve the image.

Example Limit Reverse Card Image: `https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/27551.jpg`

The image URLs are found within the JSON response as `image_url`, `image_url_small`, and `image_url_cropped`, all within the `card_images` array.

Alternative artwork (if available) will also be listed within the `card_images` array.

Since v3: Card images are now properly returned without slashes being incorrectly escaped as it was with v2.

##  Random Card
The Random Card endpoint can be found at `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/randomcard.php`.

This follows the same rate limiting procedures as the card lookup endpoint.

Cache Control is disabled for this endpoint so it should always provide a fresh card.

If any GET parameters are found in the call, then it will return an error.

##  All Card Sets
The Card Sets endpoint can be found at `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardsets.php`.

This follows the same rate limiting procedures as the card lookup endpoint.

This simply returns all of the current Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Set Names we have stored in the database.

This contains the following response info: Set Name, Set Code, Number of Cards and TCG Date (Release Date).

Use this to get a quick snapshot of all the Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Sets sorted by A-Z.

If any GET parameters are found in the call, then it will return an error.

##  Card Set Information
The Card Sets Information endpoint can be found at `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardsetsinfo.php`.

This **requires** a parameter of "setcode".

Example usage: `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardsetsinfo.php?setcode=SDY-046`

This follows the same rate limiting procedures as the card lookup endpoint.

This returns the following information: id, name, set_name, set_code, set_rarity and set_price (in $).

If no (or invalid) GET parameters are found in the call, then it will return an error.

##  All Card Archetypes
The Card Archetypes endpoint can be found at `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/archetypes.php`.

This follows the same rate limiting procedures as the card lookup endpoint.

This simply returns all of the current Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Archetype Names we have stored in the database.

Use this to get a quick snapshot of all the Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Archtypes sorted by A-Z.

If any GET parameters are found in the call, then it will return an error.

##  Check Database Version
The Card Database Version endpoint can be found at `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/checkDBVer.php`.

This follows the same rate limiting procedures as the card lookup endpoint.

This is not a cached endpoint and database_version and date are incremented when:

- New card is added to the database.
- Card information is updated/modified on the main database.

If any GET parameters are found in the call, then it will return an error.

##  Error Checking
The main features of v3 is more thorough error checking.

All error codes now return a correct 400 response header.

Almost every parameter will now return an error code if an invalid value is passed to it (as opposed to ignoring it and returning all cards like in previous versions). The user will also be prompted on all the correct possible values to pass so they aren't left guessing.

Here is an example of an invalid value sent through the attribute parameter: `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php?type=Effect%20Monster&attribute=wood&num=2`

The response returned: `{"error":"Attribute value of wood is invalid. Please use a correct attribute value. Attribute accepts 'dark', 'earth', 'fire', 'light', 'water', 'wind' or 'divine' and is not case sensitive."}`

The only way to return all cards now is by having 0 parameters in the request: `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php`. If invalid parameters are sent, an error will also be returned.

This should save users bandwidth on receiving large requests when requesting malformed urls.
